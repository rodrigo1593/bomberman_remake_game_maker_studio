what is this?
a dead project of 2019, i thought of do this for "practice" or "fun". and im impressed how nice this was, but it required more things to be identically to the nes version.

-eyes of the enemys movement (eyes up, eyes down, eyes left, eyes right)
-sound when you walk
-etc (idk i dont remember more)

well... there you go, have fun with this!

(no, dont tell me this way of coding is shit ik already XD)

bye.

OH WAIT I NEED RELEAS-




(need to tell that the /configs should be extracted if you need more. (stupid github let me put more than 100 files x,d))
